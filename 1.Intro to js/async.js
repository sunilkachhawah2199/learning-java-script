/*
Definition: Tasks can start and proceed without blocking the execution of other tasks.
Asynchronous code does not wait for a task to complete before moving to the next line. Instead, the task is handed off (e.g., to an I/O operation) and a callback or a promise handles the result when itâ€™s ready.
This is non-blocking behavior.
setTimeout is a asynchronous operation
